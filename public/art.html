                <p>My personal art. Please do not repost, edit, claim ownership, or use for generation training. I'm a real human bean after all. Be nice.</p>
                <p>Most art here is traditional media. I generally use watercolor paints and inks of various types (alcohol, acrylic, water-based). Digital art is made in Procreate on an iPad.</p>

                        <img src="img/art/under_the_whispering_door_cover.png" alt="Fan art of the book cover for Under the Whispering Door">
                        <figcaption>I read Under the Whispering Door by TJ. Klune and I ugly cried multiple times throughout. It’s poignant yet hopeful.. (as if that comes close to explaining it, as Wallace would say.) The dust jacket designed by Chris at Red Nose Studio is as beautiful as the story and I really wanted to try an urban sketch of the stacked tea shop on the front. I didn’t come close to doing the background justice and added only hints to the forest since I was focused on the building structure. I recommend reading Under the Whispering Door, as well as House in the Cerulean Sea by the same author.</figcaption>
