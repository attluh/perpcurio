                        <p>After a good year or more, I seem to be out of an art rut. It started last week when I got the urge to redraw Moon Cat for a new profile picture, which I was really happy with and based the site design off of. Gotta credit Cult of the Lamb for inspiring me too. I had so much fun with that game. Then a couple of totally unexpected things happened.</p>
                        <p>The first thing, I met a nice person in Webfishing that I was chatting about art with, and after looking at some of my pieces they asked if I sold prints. Any inclination that someone else would want my art somewhere in their sight was a new experience and it definitely gave me a mood boost. I've "started" trying to be an online artist several times in the past and I've never got anywhere. Maybe this year will be the year. I lowkey started researching at-home printers for fine art prints.</p>
                        <p>The second thing, I've become <em>really</em> interested in vtuber models. New hyperfixations find me all the time, so that's not surprising, but the vtuber part is. I never paid much attention to them before, because I guess they all kind of looked similar to me. It's also that I'm not super into anime and I feel those communities overlap quite a bit so I hadn't been exposed to much. Now that I've browsed around, wow, I'm so impressed. I can't even remember at this point what got me started down this rabbit hole, but I've been watching a lot of videos on designing and rigging the models. I have a design in mine for my own model already and I'm excited to make progress on it. It will take a fair amount of weeks or months of working on it the evenings and weekends but I'm excited about what the model could become! <small>I have a <a href="https://perpcurio.atabook.org/">guestbook</a> now. If you like any vtubers please tell me about them there!</small></p>

                        <p>The past week has been awesome. That's because I have been off work on holiday. My partner and I celebrated Winter Solstice on the first night, feeling cozy with the near two weeks off work we had in front of us. I'm halfway into that two weeks, and have made this site. That's why we're here now, me writing and you reading. If you've wandered into this hole in the web's wall, then we must be alike, in one way or another. Maybe you were born in a year that starts with 19 and long for the days of Web 1.0, or you've become so disgusted and exhausted with social media that you're seeking the less normalized side of the web. Maybe both. Either way I'm glad we're both here. I think these actions we're taking, participating in deregulated expression, make the web a better and more interesting place.</p>
                        <p>Now, who am I? <i>My name is Ash</i>. I'm a 30 something enby, pronouns they/them, and being the edge lord I am, have referred to myself as <i>Perpetually Curious</i> since I was a teen. Online you'll often find me as PerpCurio, or Attluh in gaming. My partner is called DJ, my favorite color is purple, and I think any word sounds weird if you repeat it enough times. (I dare you to say the word "brilliant" enough times until you wonder why those are sounds we use to describe that concept.) I'm obsessed with language and also a software engineer. But I don't know that I plan to talk about that stuff much. I need somewhere to write about big feels. I have a lot of those. Which leads me back to why we're here...</p>
                        <h4>The Slow Web</h4>
                        <p>I hate social media. I probably don't have to explain why in detail to you. I joined way back in the days of Xanga (that's pre-MySpace) as a tween. Every platform just sucks now and I don't want to participate. I want this site right here. My site. Where I have to take time to write an entry in html, and can chew on my thoughts without a publish button waiting to yeet my words into the ether. Where I can thoughtfully design this visual expression on the web exactly as I like it. I feel like whatever we're doing here on this side of the web, is similar to what Slow Fashion makers are doing to protest fast fashion. Just like clothes are normalized, unsustainable products that get shoved down our throats, so is content we encounter on algorithmic social media sites. Artists trying to survive on social media know this all to well with the grind to post consistently. Something I was never able to make myself do. I don't always have something to say. I don't always have a painting to show. That's why I want to be here, where I can share and archive my art and thoughts without any schedules in mind. And also to unabashedly be myself and display all the wacky shit from around the internet that I love.</p>
                        <p>I hope we all have a good time here and see some cool shit.</p>
