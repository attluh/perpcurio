                        </h3>
                        <p>With my plan to make a vtuber model, I researched and practiced several tangent skills last week.</p>

                        <h4>Web GL and Three.js</h4>

                        <p>As you may have read, if you're visiting from Neocities or Nekoweb, I want to make my entry page look like a video game menu or start screen. Currently two links prompt the user to take the portal or turn around. This is my concept's simple basis: theme the page around a portal with these intentions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Inform the user of important info before entering the site (e.g., they're leaving the community site to go to perpcurio.com)</li>
                                <li>Provide an interactive choice that transports the user one way or the other.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>With that idea in mind, I have two approaches I'm considering:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A game menu design with a partly animated background, the menu options would be the choice to take the portal or go back</li>
                                <li>A start screen where the user moves an avatar in the direction of their choice, to the portal or back where they came from</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>The first option would be much easier to implement but has less interactivity for the user. The second option would be sick, but it requires me to learn about techniques for browser graphics and may not work on mobile at all. I like the second idea, and whether I can accomplish it or not, I want to try. So, I started reading and watching videos about WebGL and Three.js. I've only dedicated a couple hours to this so far, but got a little playground environment created.</p>

                        <h4>Drawing Moon Cat</h4>

                        <p>I've drawn Mooncat several times this week and developed a few more features about my little character.
                            <ul>
                                <li>irises are the moon in different phases depending on emotion/lighting.</li>
                                <li>2 or 3 whiskers on each side of their face.</li>
                                <li>does NOT have a square body</li>
                            </ul>
                             <figure>
                                <img src="img/diary/202501/moon_cat_square_body.webp" alt="A sketch of Mooncat with a cubic body.">
                                <figcaption>The cubic body isn't really working is it...</figcaption>
                             </figure>
                        </p>

                        <p>Mooncat is likely to be the first model I try to rig in Live2D, once I figure out a body design. I still have ideas for a model for my persona, but I want to go really simple at first. Mooncat is perfect for that.</p>

                        <h4>Animation</h4>

                        <p>My only experience with animation is making very simple gif emojis in Procreate. Like the gif of Mooncat in the gify pet feature on my home page I made in procreate. From the vtuber tutorials I ended up watching tangential animation tutorials and trying out a few simple exercises in clip studio paint.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>After a good year or more, I seem to be out of an art rut. It started last week when I got the urge to redraw Moon Cat for a new profile picture, which I was really happy with and based the site design off of. Gotta credit Cult of the Lamb for inspiring me too. I had so much fun with that game. Then a couple of totally unexpected things happened.</p>
                        <p>The first thing, I met a nice person in Webfishing that I was chatting about art with, and after looking at some of my pieces they asked if I sold prints. Any inclination that someone else would want my art somewhere in their sight was a new experience and it definitely gave me a mood boost. I've "started" trying to be an online artist several times in the past and I've never got anywhere. Maybe this year will be the year. I lowkey started researching at-home printers for fine art prints.</p>
                        <p>The second thing, I've become <em>really</em> interested in vtuber models. New hyperfixations find me all the time, so that's not surprising, but the vtuber part is. I never paid much attention to them before, because I guess they all kind of looked similar to me. It's also that I'm not super into anime and I feel those communities overlap quite a bit so I hadn't been exposed to much. Now that I've browsed around, wow, I'm so impressed. I can't even remember at this point what got me started down this rabbit hole, but I've been watching a lot of videos on designing and rigging the models. I have a design in mine for my own model already and I'm excited to make progress on it. It will take a fair amount of weeks or months of working on it the evenings and weekends but I'm excited about what the model could become! <small>I have a <a href="https://perpcurio.atabook.org/">guestbook</a> now. If you like any vtubers please tell me about them there!</small></p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>The past week has been awesome. That's because I have been off work on holiday. My partner and I celebrated Winter Solstice on the first night, feeling cozy with the near two weeks off work we had in front of us. I'm halfway into that two weeks, and have made this site. That's why we're here now, me writing and you reading. If you've wandered into this hole in the web's wall, then we must be alike, in one way or another. Maybe you were born in a year that starts with 19 and long for the days of Web 1.0, or you've become so disgusted and exhausted with social media that you're seeking the less normalized side of the web. Maybe both. Either way I'm glad we're both here. I think these actions we're taking, participating in deregulated expression, make the web a better and more interesting place.</p>
                        <p>Now, who am I? <i>My name is Ash</i>. I'm a 30 something enby, pronouns they/them, and being the edge lord I am, have referred to myself as <i>Perpetually Curious</i> since I was a teen. Online you'll often find me as PerpCurio, or Attluh in gaming. My partner is called DJ, my favorite color is purple, and I think any word sounds weird if you repeat it enough times. (I dare you to say the word "brilliant" enough times until you wonder why those are sounds we use to describe that concept.) I'm obsessed with language and also a software engineer. But I don't know that I plan to talk about that stuff much. I need somewhere to write about big feels. I have a lot of those. Which leads me back to why we're here...</p>
                        <h4>The Slow Web</h4>
                        <p>I hate social media. I probably don't have to explain why in detail to you. I joined way back in the days of Xanga (that's pre-MySpace) as a tween. Every platform just sucks now and I don't want to participate. I want this site right here. My site. Where I have to take time to write an entry in html, and can chew on my thoughts without a publish button waiting to yeet my words into the ether. Where I can thoughtfully design this visual expression on the web exactly as I like it. I feel like whatever we're doing here on this side of the web, is similar to what Slow Fashion makers are doing to protest fast fashion. Just like clothes are normalized, unsustainable products that get shoved down our throats, so is content we encounter on algorithmic social media sites. Artists trying to survive on social media know this all to well with the grind to post consistently. Something I was never able to make myself do. I don't always have something to say. I don't always have a painting to show. That's why I want to be here, where I can share and archive my art and thoughts without any schedules in mind. And also to unabashedly be myself and display all the wacky shit from around the internet that I love.</p>
                        <p>I hope we all have a good time here and see some cool shit.</p>
